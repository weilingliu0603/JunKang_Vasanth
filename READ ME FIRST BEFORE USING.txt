The Jurong Pionner Salon Application by Vasanth and Jun Kang

- We apologise for the late submission due to delays and bugs

- Please note the following when using the application 

> Try to use a monitor that is 1920x1080 in resolution. I have tried my best to support different sizes but for the best experience, use that resolution.

> The checks for inputs are quite minimal and you are likely to either get away with wrong inputs or get an error if you try it out. 
However, it should work fine if correct inputs are used as we assume that the admins will key the info correctly.
If you want to try out the input checks, use digits instead of characters or vice versa that supports the latter.
E.g.: Using a non-existent member ID will likely cause an error for new transaction

> In Transactions, Blue represents Guests, Gold represent Gold membership and discounted transactions.

> The selection of membership in new transaction is on purpose for non-guests. This is not because we are lazy to check if they are a member or not but rather
in the case where an admin may forget to change the membership status before adding a new transaction (see next point also). The membership option just means
whether a discount of 10% should be applied.

> Transactions cannot be edited

> There is no searching for a specific date of transaction. You just have to scroll until you find the day that you want to view as it is sorted by date, in DESC order.

> Data used in the database may contain easter eggs that you might not get. Most data would not reflect real life data as it is just test data.

> The value at the bottom right of Overview page is the sum of all revenue in the lifetime

> Key Dates in DD/MM/YYYY where if the DD or MM is single digit, ensure a 0 is infront. e.g: 04/04/2020
